          3D E-commerce First, in our Web 3 and Metaverse program, we are
          learning to develop Web 1, and Web 2 websites and apps. Later we will
          learn to develop Web 3 and 3D Commerce templates and experiences. But
          we have to start thinking right now. Let's understand what one virtual
          store builder company is doing the company name is Emperia.
          https://emperiavr.com/ “Using technology, Emperia aims to make virtual
          worlds into the future of e-commerce, expanding the reach to new and
          future online shoppers, increasing brand loyalty, and creating a
          completely new shopping experience.” Emporia just got funded:
