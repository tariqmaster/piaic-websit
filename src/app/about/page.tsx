          development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies expand
          the internet as we know it by introducing novel features and
          advancements. Metaverse will make use of all aspects of modern
          technology, including 3D, VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud computing,
          voice computing, ambient computing, and more. Citi is the latest Wall
          Street business to give a positive prognosis for Web 3.0 and the
          Metaverse, terms used to depict a future internet vision centred on
          decentralised technologies and virtual worlds. Citi stated in a March
          2022 research paper that the metaverse economy might have a total
          addressable market of up to $13 trillion and five billion people by
          2030.

            leverage to build internet-scale apps. For the frontend

            with Redux and Storyboard. I prefer Netlify and Firebase for client
            edge deployments. For building serverless apps, I use AWS Lambda
            Functions, Step Functions, and EventBridge with Serverless
            Framework. For container deployments I prefer Google Cloud Run or
            Kubernetes. I use MongoDB and FaunaDB for the database layer and
            FireStore for realtime databases. Terraform and GitHub Actions serve
            as my preferred tools for writing Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD.
